## Purpose
This research paper explores the advancements in biotechnology and artificial intelligence that are shaping the future of human augmentation. It provides a deep dive into how humans may surpass biological evolution through engineered modifications in intelligence, physical ability, and longevity.
I have included this research as I believe it reflects both my deep intellectual curiosity about the augmentation and adaptation of human physiology through technology, as well as my conviction that we are on the cusp of guiding our own evolution for the first time in the history of organic life. It also showcases the breadth of my knowledge across a wide range of biotechnologies, from neural interfaces to genetic engineering and beyond.
