## Project Overview
The development of an advanced dexterous prosthetic hand was undertaken to explore the limits of biomimetic robotics. This project involved replicating the intricate structure, range of motion, and dynamic control of the human hand using custom-designed mechanical linkages, embedded systems, and sophisticated control algorithms.

## Key Objectives
- Replicate human-like dexterity and motion.
- Achieve real-time control for complex finger movements.
- Optimize for compact form factor and lightweight design.
- Integrate robust control algorithms for precise actuation.

## Design and Development
### Mechanical Design
The hand features a complex linkage mechanism replicating the natural biomechanics of human fingers. Utilizing SolidWorks for CAD modeling, stress analysis was conducted to ensure structural integrity under dynamic loads.

### Embedded Systems
Microcontrollers (Arduino and STM32) were employed to manage the control of 15 motors, encoders, and drivers, ensuring real-time response and precision.

### Control Algorithms
The control system integrates inverse kinematics models to map finger joint positions accurately. The algorithms handle real-time feedback for smooth and coordinated finger movements.

### Prototyping & Fabrication
The hand was prototyped using 3D printing technologies (FDM and PolyJet) and assembled with precision components to maintain the delicate balance between durability and lightweight design.
